```markdown
Algebra and Geometry 1 (2012-2013 Semester2)

Algebra and Geometry 2 (2013-2014 Semester1)

These courses are combination of linear algebra and analytic geometry. The linear algebra
part covers the concept of determinant, matrix, linear transform, linear space, eigenvalues,
quadratic form and Euclidean space. And the geometry parts contains important concepts 
such as Cartesian coordinate system and quadric surface (ellipsoid, sphere and paraboloid).

### 2. Course(s) in calculus in one-variable

```markdown
Mathematics (2012-2013 Semester1) 

This course focuses on advanced calculus tools and the derivation procedure of such tools.
It covers real number theory, concept of limits (the limit of a sequence and a function), 
definitions and properties of continuous functions, differential calculus (differentiable 
functions, rules of differentiation, etc.) and integration.

### 3. Course(s) corresponding to Calculus in several variables 

```markdown
Engineering Mathematical Analysis 3 (2013-2014 Semester2)

This courses aims to provide an in-depth understanding of multivariable calculus, infinite 
series and basics of differential equations. The multivariable part covers partial 
derivative, integral depending on a parameter, polar coordinate system, line, surface
and volume integral, Green’s theorem, the Gauss-Ostrogradskii formula, Stokes’ formula,
vector analysis and field theory.

### 4. Course(s) corresponding to Probability theory and statistics 

```markdown
Probability and Mathematical Statistcs (2014-2015 Semester2)

This course covers topics such as random events and probability, random variables and
their probability distribution, numerical characteristics of random variables, central
limit phenomena, concepts on mathematical statistics, parameter estimation and 
hypothesis test.
```


### 5. Course(s) corresponding to Programming 

```markdown
Introduction to Computing (2012-2013 Semester2)

This course provides an introduction to the concept of computational complexity. 
It also investigate basic sorting algorithms and analysis their computational complexity,
such as Quicksort, Merge sort and Insertion sort.

Computer Programming 1 (2013-2014 Semester1)

The course covers the basic grammar of C++ and programming concepts including procedural
programming, basic control structures (sequence, if/else, for loop, while loop), array, 
struct and pointer. Introduction to object-oriented programming is also introduced.

Computer Programming 2 (2013-2014 Semester2)

This course aims to familiarize students with C# and advanced concepts of object-oriented 
programming. It covers design and implementation of class, creating and initializing 
objects (providing initial values member variables), inheritance of public and protected 
classes and file processing.

Assemble Language (2014-2015 Semester2)

This course focuses on 80x86 assemble language. It covers structures and components of 
Intel 8086 CPU (register, flag etc.), mnemonic that has been used to represent each 
low-level machine instruction or operation and implementation of loop and recursion with
assemble language.

Pattern Recognition (2015-2016 Semester2)
This course deals with the fundamentals of characterizing and recognizing patterns and
features of interest in numerical data. We discuss the basic tools and theories for 
signal understanding problems with applications to face recognition and more. It also 
covers decision theory, statistical classification, maximum likelihood and Bayesian 
estimation, nonparametric methods, unsupervised learning and clustering.
```

### 6. Course(s) corresponding to Algorithms and Data Structures 

```markdown
Data Structures and Algorithms(A) (2014-2015 Semester1)
Data Structure and Algorithms is the fundamental core course of computer science. This
course covers the concepts of common data structure such as linear table, stack, leap,
tree, graph and their impletations. This course also introduces sorting and indexing 
algorithms. And basics of algorithm complexity analysis are also included in the course.
